        <h1>3rd</h1>
        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>I have taken some time to reflect on everything, and I wanted to share my thoughts with you.

            First, I want to apologize if my actions or words have upset you in any way. I acknowledge that I might have been too much at times—masyadong feeling jowa, kumbaga—and for that, I am sorry. I understand how you may have felt frustrated or even hurt by some of the things that happened between us. Your feelings are valid, and I never intended to cause any negativity.
            
            On the other hand, I feel like things got too serious for both of us. You, you're too quick to get upset, and as for me, I'm acting like a girlfriend. Looking back, it is almost funny how we both ended up in this cycle—emotions running high and expectations getting out of hand.
            
            That being said, I believe we both deserve a fresh start. If you are open to it, I would like to suggest that we hit the reset button for the third time. This time, I'll take it easy, no expectations, and let things unfold naturally. Third chances are a charm, and I am willing to give it a genuine shot if you are. I hope we can both approach this with a lighter and more open mindset.
            
            I know third chances are rare, but they are worth it if both sides are willing to try. I value you as a person, and I sincerely think we do have a great spark. I value the connection we had, and I would like to believe we can build something better this time around, without adding any commitments or pressure.
            
            Thank you for always giving me a chance, despite everything. I really hope you will consider a third try, and we can see where things go from here.
            
            Let me know what you think. No pressure either way—just putting this out there with an open heart and good intentions.</p>
        <p>Yours,</p>
        <p>Hello</p>
